  <h2>WHAT IS CONSIGN.NYC?</h2>

    <p>CONSIGN.NYC is the only platform that provides a curated list of high end consignment shops in New York City with complete information regarding purchase and sale terms.</p>

    <p>CONSIGN.NYC provides a variety of <a href="/forstores" target="_blank" alt="high end consignment nyc">unique benefits to stores</a>, consignors and shoppers.</p>

    <p>Local stores now have to compete with several fashon tech startups in the online consignment space. While online consignment can be convenient, there are often authenticity issues with high end items and consignors lack bargaining power over the price of their items. When items are not accepted, consignors often have to pay a fee to have their items returned, or can choose to donate their items with no tax benefits. Online consignment is primarily a volume-driven business, and can lack authenticity for high end items.</p>

    <p>CONSIGN.NYC aims to drive traffic back to New York City's local stores, and the personal experience and guaranteed authenticity they provide to consignors and consumers.</p>

  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

    <p>CONSIGN.NYC was founded by <a href="http://twitter.com/korenlc" alt="koren leslie cohen" target="_blank">Koren Leslie Cohen</a>, a lawyer turned web developer presently working as an engineer in the fashion industry.</p>

    <p>When Koren moved to New York years ago, she moved from a spacious apartment with multiple closets in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston to a tiny studio in Murray Hill. The one closet in her apartment was overflowing with clothes, and she quickly realized she needed to make some adjustments to her living situation.</p>

    <p>Koren inventoried her clothes and began a search for the best stores in the city to sell her new and gently worn high end items. This involved reading numerous blogs containing inaccurate or incomplete information, cross-referencing those blogs with various review sites, and calling each suitable store directly for their consignment terms. The process was lengthy and frustrating.</p>

<!--     <p>A few years ago, Koren started a blog about travel and New York City, and wrote a post about the Best Upper East Side Consignment Shops for Scoring a High End Deal. This post is one of the top-ranked articles on Google for high end consignment on the Upper East Side and in New York City generally. The post also remains the most heavily trafficked post on her blog.</p> -->

    <p>Recognizing the obvious thirst for this information and the clear lack of organization and reliability of available material, CONSIGN.NYC was born.</p>
