  <h2>What is CONSIGN.NYC?</h2>

    <p>CONSIGN.NYC is the only platform that provides a curated list of high end consignment shops in New York City with complete information regarding purchase and sale terms.</p>

    <p>CONSIGN.NYC provides a variety of unique benefits to stores, sellers and shoppers.</p>

  <h2>What's the story behind CONSIGN.NYC?</h2>

    <p>CONSIGN.NYC was founded by <a href="http://korenlc.com" alt="koren leslie cohen" target="_blank">Koren Leslie Cohen</a>, a lawyer turned web developer presently working as an engineer in the fashion industry.</p>

    <p>When Koren moved to New York six years ago, she moved from a spacious apartment with multiple closets in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston to a tiny apartment in Murray Hill. The one closet in her apartment was overflowing with clothes, and she quickly realized she needed to make some adjustments to her storage situation.</p>

    <p>Koren inventoried her clothes and began a search for the best stores in the city to sell her new and gently worn high end items. This involved reading numerous blogs containing inaccurate or incomplete information, cross-referencing that information with various review sites, and calling each suitable store directly to get their consignment terms. The process was lengthy and frustrating.</p>

    <p>In 2012, Koren started a blog about travel and New York City, and wrote a post about the Best Upper East Side Consignment Shops for Scoring a High End Deal. This post is one of the top-ranked articles on Google for high end consignment on the Upper East Side and in New York City generally. The post also remains the most heavily trafficked post on her blog.</p>

    <p>Recognizing the obvious thirst for this information and the clear lack of organization and reliability of available information, CONSIGN.NYC was born.</p>
