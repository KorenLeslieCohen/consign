TODO:

    * Set up an application on Google Analytics
    * You will need to add your analytics tracking code to `config/secrets.yml`
  5. Set up Airbrake (Optional)
    * If you entered your api key during project creation, you're all set!
    * Otherwise, visit [Airbrake](https://airbrake.io/account/new/Free) and set
    up a free account.
    * When it asks for "subdomain", it really means "username" (it's also a required
      field, even though it doesn't seem like it)
    * Generate your api key, then on your command line (in the project root), run:
      `rails g airbrake --api-key your_api_key_here

Deploying to Heroku:
  1. `bin/setup [<app_name>]`
    * <app_name> is optional. It will, by default, attempt to create an
    app on Heroku using your Rails application name.
  2. `bin/deploy`

Deploying to Ninefold:
